These actions ¡ª exercises in American strength ¡ª have had a major impact. China¡¯s largest stock exchange fell by 25 percent in the first nine months of this year, in large part because our administration has been standing strong against Beijing¡¯s trade practices.

As President Trump has made clear, we don¡¯t want China¡¯s markets to suffer. In fact, we want them to thrive. But the United States wants Beijing to pursue trade policies that are free, fair, and reciprocal. And we will continue to stand and demand that they do. (Applause.)

Sadly, China¡¯s rulers, thus far, have refused to take that path. The American people deserve to know: In response to the strong stand that President Trump has taken, Beijing is pursuing a comprehensive and coordinated campaign to undermine support for the President, our agenda, and our nation¡¯s most cherished ideals.

I want to tell you today what we know about China¡¯s actions here at home ¡ª some of which we¡¯ve gleaned from intelligence assessments, some of which are publicly available. But all of which are fact.

As I said before, as we speak, Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach to advance its influence and benefit its interests. It¡¯s employing this power in more proactive and coercive ways to interfere in the domestic policies of this country and to interfere in the politics of the United States.

The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.
